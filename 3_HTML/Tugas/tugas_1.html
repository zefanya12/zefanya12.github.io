        <b>Artificial intelligence</b> is the simulation of 
        human intelligence processes by machines, especially 
        computer systems. 
        Specific applications of AI include expert systems, 
        natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.

        As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling 
        to promote how their products and services use it. 
        Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a component of the 
        technology, such as machine learning. 
        AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for 
        writing and training machine learning algorithms. 
        No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, 
        R, Java, C++ and Julia have features popular with AI developers.
    </p>
    <p align="justify">
        In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled 
        training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and 
        using these patterns to make predictions about future states. 
        In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to 
        generate lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition 
        tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing 
        millions of examples.
        New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create realistic 
        text, images, music and other media.
