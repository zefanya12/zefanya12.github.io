        <b>Artificial intelligence</b> is the simulation of <i>human intelligence</i> 
        processes by machines, especially computer systems. 
        Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language 
        processing, speech recognition and machine vision.

        As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to 
        promote how their products and services use it. 
        Often, what they refer to as AI is simply a component of the technology,
        such as machine learning. 
        AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing 
        and training machine learning algorithms. 
        No single programming language is synonymous with AI, but Python, R, Java, 
        C++ and Julia have features popular with AI developers.
        <br />
        In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training 
        data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these 
        patterns to make predictions about future states. 
        In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text can learn to generate 
        lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to 
        identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.
        New, rapidly improving generative AI techniques can create realistic text, 
        images, music and other media.
